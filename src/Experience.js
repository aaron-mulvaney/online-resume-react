                My current role as Application Support Engineer at HMH is comprised of many responsibilities such as:
                Design, development and maintenance of tools to triage/solve customer issues (tickets), assisting offshore vendor teams with their Sprint planning and providing intervention if required,
                triaging complex customer issues on a multi-platform/product level. Other tasks include documentation of all tools and services provided by the Support Operations Department,
                fulfilling feature requests on our Release Management System which is comprised of a Java Web application hosted using Tomcat, along with a MySQL Database.

              <p>
                Working under Managed Services Practice at Version 1, I worked maintaining existing customer Middleware (XSLT) systems. Creating XML maps in conjunction with XSD schemas to transform incoming messages into new formats required by the customer.
                Handling/Completing customer feature/workflow requests, there was a lot involved in this process: Initially a customer would request a new feature or workflow on the Middleware system, I was first point of contact, we would assist the customer in completing a request
                with as much information as possible in order to provide an accurate cost estimate (also provided by me). Once confirmed by the customer I would develop the new feature End to End, testing heavily throughout. All work was tracked using an internal ticketing system similar to JIRA.

                My internship with Openet was my first exposure with large scale business applications, both implemented and in development.
                In an Agile environment my team worked to deliver bespoke functionality on existing products for customers.
                We used Kanban methodology with the use of JIRA to maintain tasks on each project. E2E testing was necessary to ensure the added functionality performed as expected.
