              <p>
                Working under Managed Services Practice at Version 1, I worked with existing customer Middleware (XSLT) systems. Creating XML maps in conjunction with XSD schemas to transform incoming messages into new formats required by the customer.
                Handling/Completing customer feature/workflow requests, there was a lot involved in this process: Initially a customer would request a new feature or workflow on the Middleware system, I was first point of contact, we would assist the customer in completing a request
                with as much information as possible in order to provide an accurate cost estimate (also provided by me). Once confirmed by the customer I would develop the new feature End to End, testing heavily throughout. All work was tracked using an internal ticketing system similar to JIRA.

                In an Agile environment my team worked to deliver bespoke functionality on existing products for customers.
                We used Kanban methodology with the use of JIRA to maintain tasks on each project. E2E testing was necessary to ensure the added functionality performed as expected.
